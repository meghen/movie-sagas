# Movie Sagas Master

## Description

_Duration: 1 Weekend Sprint_

The goal of this app is to show movies stored in the database. There are two different views - the all movies page and the movie details page. The all movies page only shows movie title and a poster, where as when the user clicks into a given movie, they will be able to not only read the description, but also make changes to the title or description.


### Built With

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
